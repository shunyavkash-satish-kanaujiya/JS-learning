    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Closure</h1>
    <p>A closure is a function that has access to variables from its parent scope even after the parent function has finished executing.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a closure:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            function outer() {
                let count = 0;
                return function inner() {
                    return count++;
                }
            }
            let counter = outer();
            console.log(counter()); // 0
            console.log(counter()); // 1
            console.log(counter()); // 2
            console.log(counter()); // 3


            // The inner function has access to the count variable from the outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing.
            console.log(count);
             // ReferenceError: count is not defined
    <p>In this example, the inner function has access to the count variable from the outer function because it is a closure. The inner function is returned by the outer function, and the outer function has finished executing, but the inner function still has access to the count variable.</p>
    <p>Closures are commonly used in JavaScript to create private variables and share state between functions.</p>
    <h2>Note: Closures can also be created using IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) and other techniques, but they are less commonly used in modern JavaScript.</h2>
