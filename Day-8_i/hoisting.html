    <p>JavaScript hoisting is a JavaScript feature where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means that you can access a variable or function before it has been declared or defined.</p>

    <p>Important Note:- Javascript only hoists declarations, not initializations. the variable will be undefined until the line where its initialized is reached</p>
