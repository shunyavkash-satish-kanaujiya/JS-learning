    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Object</h1>
    <p>Object is a non-primitive data type in JavaScript. It is a collection of
        properties and methods.</p>
    <p>Objects are created using curly braces {} and have properties and methods defined inside them.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of an object:</p>
    <pre>
        let person = {
            name: "satish",
            age: 22,
            greet: function() {
                console.log('Hello, my name is'+ this.name);
            }
        };
        </pre>
    <p>To access a property or method of an object, you can use dot notation or square bracket notation.</p>
    <p>For example, person.name will return 'satish', and person.greet() will log 'Hello, my name is satish'.</p>
    <p>Objects can also have nested objects and arrays as properties.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of an object with nested objects and arrays:</p>
    <pre>
            let person = {
                name: "satish",
                age: 22,
                address: {
                    street: '123 Main St',
                    city: 'surat'
                },
                hobbies: ['reading', 'painting', 'cooking']
            };
            </pre>
    <p>To access a property or method of a nested object or array, you can use dot notation or square bracket notation with the nested property or array index.</p>
    <p>For example, person.address.street will return '123 Main St', and person.hobbies[1] will return 'painting'.</p>
